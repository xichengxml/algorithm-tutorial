The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
```swagger codegen
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
6.     21112211
7.     1221112221
```
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.<br/>
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.<br/>
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.<br/>
Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.<br/>
Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
Example 1:

```swagger codegen
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```
Example 2:
```swagger codegen
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```
